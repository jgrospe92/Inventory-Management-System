# Project Overview :chart_with_upwards_trend:
- The project being presented is a Inventory Management System desktop application. The goal is to improve the client's current inventory system. Our client is Rose hill foods inc located in Montreal, it was founded in 1983 by George Serbanis and his team of professionals. Rosehill inc foods manufactures and supplies the food service industry with quality soups, sauces, seasonings, and along with its Original 86 division, offers a wide range of premium grade, high-end products such as stock bases, liquid sauces, marinades and glazes. To make the prototype app we are determined to communicate every weekday and once every sunday. In these meetings each person provides a summary of what they are working on, progress updates and any blockers. We will closely keep track of individual progress and to make sure that no one is behind on the project schedule.
